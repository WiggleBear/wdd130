                <p>Taiwan has some of the best-tasting food in all of Southeast Asia. Most of these unique food items can be found in Taiwan's night markets which are scattered across the island's various cities.

                <h3>Taiwan Sausage</h3>

                <p>The first food item I'd recommend is Taiwanese sausages. They're made from pork and have a unique blend of savory and sweet, usually served with a clove of garlic.

                <img class="card-img" src="images/stinky-tofu.jpg" alt="stinky tofu image">
                <p>The next food I'd suggest is Taiwan's stinky tofu, which is usually served fried and with a generous helping of pickled cabbage. The smell, although unpleasant to some, comes with a unique taste many Taiwanese crave.

                <p>Next is their famous oyster omelets, which are, as you might have guessed, made with oysters, eggs, and a unique sauce similar to ketchup.

                <p>Another popular Taiwanese food that is making its way around the world is brown sugar boba drinks. These drinks can be found just about anywhere where there is a large population of Chinese-speaking people and has become popular with western cultures as well.

                <p>Taiwan is also known for its shaved snow desserts, which are frozen cream topped with fresh fruits and sweetened condensed milk. The perfect treat for Taiwan's hot summer days.
