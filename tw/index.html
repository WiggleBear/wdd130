                <p>The island of Taiwan is located approximately 230 miles (370km) off the southeast coast of China. And shares maritime borders with China, Japan, and the Philippians. Taiwan has been a part of the Chinese and Japanese territories throughout the centuries. And was a Japanese territory until, after their defeat in WW2, when China was able to reclaim control of the island in 1945.
                    However, a few years later, China was entrenched in a civil war between the Nationalist and Communist parties. 
                    Following the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, a general and politician of the Chinese National Army named Chiang Kai-Shek led approximately two million soldiers and millions of citizens to the island of Taiwan, fleeing the new Communist-ruled China.

                <p> Chiang Kai-shek's original plan was to regroup in Taiwan and eventually lead an army back to mainland China and retake the government for the Nationalist party.
                    However, once it became apparent, that plan would not come to fruition. The Taiwanese government declared its independence from Communist-led China and focused on its own interests, primarily modernization and economic development. Taiwan today is a modern first-world country. That enjoys many freedoms, has a highly educated populace, efficient public transportation, and is a leader in developing electronics and microchips.
