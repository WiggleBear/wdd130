                <p>The island of Taiwan is located approximately 230 miles (370km) off the southeast coast of China. And shares maritime borders with China, Japan, and the Philippians. Taiwan has been a part of the Chinese and Japanese territories throughout the centuries. And was a Japanese territory until, after their defeat in WW2, when China was able to reclaim control of the island in 1945.
                    <br/>
                    However, a few years later, China was entrenched in a civil war between the Nationalist and Communist parties.

                    However, once it became apparent, that plan would not come to fruition. The Taiwanese government declared its independence from Communist-led China and focused on its own interests, primarily modernization and economic development. Taiwan today is a modern first-world country. That enjoys many freedoms, has a highly educated populace, efficient public transportation, and is a leader in developing electronics and microchips.
